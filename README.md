# Instagram Reach Analysis and Prediction Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to provide insights and predictions regarding the reach of Instagram posts using data collected from my Instagram account. This project is particularly valuable for data science students interested in learning about Instagram reach analysis with Python.

## Dataset
 The dataset contains information about the reach of Instagram posts collected over a week.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data manually from Instagram posts.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.

4. **Modeling**: Building and training machine learning models to predict Instagram post reach.

5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models to ensure accuracy and reliability.

6. **Results**: Summarizing findings and providing actionable insights based on the analysis and model performance.
