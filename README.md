Instagram Reach Analysis and Prediction Project
Project Overview
The Instagram Reach Analysis and Prediction Project aims to provide valuable insights and predictions regarding the reach of Instagram posts based on data collected from an Instagram account. This project is especially beneficial for data science students who are interested in learning about Instagram reach analysis using Python.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded here. It includes detailed information about the reach of Instagram posts recorded over the course of a week.

Project Structure
Data Collection: This step involves manually collecting data from Instagram posts.

Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summaries are created to understand the dataset and identify patterns.

Modeling: Machine learning models are built and trained to predict the reach of Instagram posts based on the prepared data.

Evaluation: The performance of the machine learning models is assessed to determine their effectiveness in predicting Instagram reach.

Results: Findings are summarized, and actionable insights are provided based on the analysis and model performance.
